# Compilation Examples

## Introduction

This directory hosts a collection of examples demonstrating various compilation 
techniques, primarily focused on C programming. These examples are part of the 
Software Development Tools course at ENSICAEN and are designed to help students 
understand the compilation process in detail.

## Contents
The `compilation` directory includes sample programs and scripts that illustrate 
different aspects of compiling C programs, including the use of makefiles, compiler 
options, and handling of multiple source files.

## How to Use
To use these compilation examples:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alainlebret/odl.git`
2. Navigate to the `compilation` directory: `cd odl/exemplier/compilation`
3. Follow the instructions in each example to compile and run the programs. This typically involves using the `gcc` compiler or `make` command.

## Prerequisites
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C compiler
- Basic knowledge of C programming and command-line operations
